# Chandrabhan Singh

Frontend Engineer | JavaScript, React, Vue  
Building scalable UIs, automation tools, and performance-driven frontend systems

---

## What I Do

I design and build production-grade frontend applications with a strong focus on:
- predictable state management
- async behavior correctness
- performance and maintainability
- real-world problem solving over toy demos

I also work on automation and tooling where frontend meets backend and browser internals.

---

## Current Focus

- Frontend architecture and system-level thinking  
- Advanced JavaScript (async patterns, event loop, memory, browser lifecycle)  
- UI performance optimization and large-scale component design  
- Automation using Node.js and browser tooling  

---

## Tech Stack

**Core**
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- React
- Vue 2 / Vue 3

**Backend & Automation**
- Node.js
- REST APIs
- Puppeteer

**Tooling**
- Git
- Babel
- Webpack
- Linux-based dev environments

**Concepts**
- Async JavaScript & concurrency
- Browser internals
- Frontend architecture
- Performance trade-offs

---

## Selected Projects

### 🔹 Frontend Automation & Job Flow Tools
Automation around form flows, browser interactions, and data handling using Node.js and Puppeteer.

**Highlights**
- DOM-driven automation
- Resilient selectors and retries
- Real-world constraints (auth, async waits, failures)

---

### 🔹 UI-Heavy Platforms & Dashboards
Frontend systems with complex state, tables, modals, and workflows.

**Highlights**
- Component decomposition
- State normalization
- Performance-aware rendering
- Maintainable styling architecture

---

### 🔹 JavaScript & Frontend Notes
Structured notes and experiments around:
- event loop & async execution
- promises, queues, and microtasks
- browser request lifecycle
- architectural decisions

---

## How I Approach Problems

- Clarity over clever abstractions
- Break UI into predictable, testable units
- Avoid premature abstractions
- Measure performance before optimizing
- Prefer boring, maintainable solutions that scale

---

## What You’ll See on This Profile

- Meaningful commits with intent
- Actively maintained repositories
- Fewer projects, but deeper execution
- Documentation focused on reasoning, not just results

---

## Open To

- Frontend Engineer / SDE-2 roles
- UI-heavy product teams
- Engineering cultures that value depth and ownership
